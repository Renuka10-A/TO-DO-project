This Angular project is a simple To-Do List application that allows users to manage tasks effectively. The app includes two main components: one for displaying a list of tasks and one for adding/editing tasks. Users can view task details such as assigned person, status, due date, priority, and comments. Tasks can be added, edited, or deleted. The application is responsive, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. The data is managed using a service that stores tasks in memory. Further enhancements can include backend integration and more advanced features.
